# simple_login.py
A very simple python login, easy to crack so dont use it for anything data sensitive

I use a file I call shoe_string to tie it together in a little safer way, its just a module that imports the login so that your password and username arent all in the same file. This is still simple to crack though. 

Im very new to python so this is just a beginners code, I know there are more efficient ways of doing this.
